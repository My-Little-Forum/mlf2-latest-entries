# Extra page for latest postings

## Purpose of the script

Several operators of instances of the [My Little Forum script](https://mylittleforum.net/) asked for a script to show the latest postings of their forum outside of the forum itself in a different page of the website. After repeated questions, H. Sch√ºtz decided to hand over a script for that purpose, he developed for his own forum (an instance of My Little Forum 1.8 (never released version)).
